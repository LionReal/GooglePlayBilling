# In-app billing in Kivy Applications

This repository contains an application structure that works with Kivy, which allows you to make in-app purchases using the Google Play Billing Library 6.0.1.

You can use it for Purchased Consumable Products.
There are no subscription modules.


You can access the license cake used in the application in the following way:

Your License Key from Google Developer console. This will be used to verify purchase signatures. You can pass NULL if you would like to skip this check (You can find your key in Google Play Console -> Your App Name -> Services & APIs)

You must define the items used in the application as consumable products via the Goole play console.
